<h3><b>Rules</b></h3><br>
The main objective of the game is to have higher health points(HP) than the enemy at the completion of both hands.

The game has three major classes of characters. Offensive, special and legendary.

**Offensive:** These cards can deal three types of damage, physical, alchemy and true. Only true damage can get past any and all defences of the enemy.

**Special:** They include defensive cards. Alchemy defensive cards can defend against alchemy damage and physical defence against physical cards. Not all special cards are defensive in nature. Some of them can heal you or remove cards from enemy hand entirely.

**Legendary:** There are four legendary cards as of yet. They are free of any usual special card moves such as destruction or theft. Physical and Alchemy damage done by them can however be blocked using the appropriate defensive cards.

At the start of the round you draw 7 cards and one legendary card. You can hover over the cards to see it's abilities or read it's lore. The match ends when either of the players runs out of hp or both run out of cards, in which case the person with the highest hp is declared winner.

It pays off to read the abilities of all the cards because some of them can be comboed to do a huge amount of damage or block the same. Particular cards have a very higher damage early game while others are of a late game nature. Ceck the guide by clicking the guide icon on the left panel.
